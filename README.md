doppler
=======

Abstract
--------

Multidoppleration is an oft-talked-about, yet rarely seen, advanced technique
to colocate and corroborate the ins and outs and arounds of waveforms
propagating through heterogenous (but only negligibly) mediums. They are not
pleased when we hit them with tuning forks, as it messes up their parallel
connection to purgatory. We've expanded upon this with novel additions that
include taking into account the effects of circumnavigation, egomotion,
ergonomics, and ergot. The results of our novel extensions were found to
greatly decrease income inequality in cross-correlated sage communities. We
finally conclude with a brief proof that P != NP.


Filtering
---------

To check out the dart filtering:

 * import util
 * util.draw_all()

There's no piping yet and it's only running on test data but the filter seems to work.


Detection Flow
--------------

If you have already filtered data, you can pass it through the zero-detection, event alignment, and multilateration steps via:
`python util.py | python zero_detection.py | python alignment.py | python multilateration.py`

`python util.py` generates a sin wave.
